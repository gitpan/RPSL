NAME
    RPSL - Router Policy Specification Language

SYNOPSIS
      perldoc RPSL

DESCRIPTION
    ATTENTION: This module is just a placeholder. You probably want the
    RPSL::Parser module, if you're interested in parsing RPSL objects into
    Perl code.

    The RFC 2622 specifies a domain specific language named Router Policy
    Specification Language (RPSL). This language is used by Regional
    Internet Registries (RIRs), Local Internet Registries (LIRs) and
    Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to describe their routing policies and
    connection related information (like Autonomos Systems, administrative
    and technical contacts, abuse mailboxes, etc).

    The RPSL is used around the globe by people working with IP address
    space management and abuse management to identify and cooperate with
    their corresponding neighbour networks.

    As this is a high-volume and somewhat complex non structured declarative
    language, it's essential to be able to read and write it to several
    different programming languages, in order to be able to automate the
    jobs related to RPSL-encoded information.

    The purpose of all modules under the RPSL namespace is exactly this:
    provide a standard, easy-to-use, RFC-compliant object-oriented
    programming library to allow people to write programs able to read and
    write proper RPSL.
