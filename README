RPSL - Router Policy Specification Language
===========================================

ATTENTION: This module is just a placeholder. You probably want the
RPSL::Parser module, if you're interested in parsing RPSL objects into Perl
code.

The RFC 2622 specifies a domain specific language named Router Policy
Specification Language (RPSL). This language is used by Regional Internet
Registries (RIRs), Local Internet Registries (LIRs) and Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to describe their routing policies and connection related
information (like Autonomos Systems, administrative and technical contacts,
abuse mailboxes, etc).

The RPSL is used around the globe by people working with IP address space
management and abuse management to identify and cooperate with their
corresponding neighbour networks.

As this is a high-volume and somewhat complex non structured declarative
language, it's essential to be able to read and write it to several different
programming languages, in order to be able to automate the jobs related to
RPSL-encoded information. 

The purpose of all modules under the RPSL namespace is exactly this: provide a
standard, easy-to-use, RFC-compliant object-oriented programming library to
allow people to write programs able to read and write proper RPSL.

INSTALLATION
